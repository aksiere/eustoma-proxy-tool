it is a fork of [go-shadowsocks2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2) with the addition of `systray`, designed to proxy a shadowsocks connection (with `ssconf` support).

## features
- `ssconf` support: use dynamic outline keys to connect
- `systray`: no terminals! just a tray icon and one item in the context menu - shutdown
