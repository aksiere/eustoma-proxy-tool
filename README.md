## created for eusto.ma users with ü§ç
it is a fork of [go-shadowsocks2](https://github.com/shadowsocks/go-shadowsocks2) with the addition of `systray`, designed to proxy a shadowsocks connection (with `ssconf` support).

## features
- **added ssconf support**: use outline's dynamic keys to connect
- **added systray**: no terminals! only a tray icon and one item in its context menu - the shutdown button
